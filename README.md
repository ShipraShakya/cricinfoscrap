Cricket Website Scrapping
I wrote a script using axios, jsdom, excel4node and pdf4lib which scraps WorldCup 2019 scorecards from cricinfo and stores that in excel sheets and pdf form. The purpose of writing this script was to get familiar with using npm modules and promises in JavaScript.
# How:
1. create a folder and run command npm init -y in the terminal, the terminal location must be of that folder
2. copy and paste or download the zip folder
